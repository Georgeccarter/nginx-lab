# nginx
Nginx is a high-performance, open-source web server designed for speed, scalability, and efficiency. It serves static web pages, handles reverse-proxying to backend applications, and manages load balancing across multiple servers. 
Known for its low resource usage and ability to handle thousands of simultaneous connections, Nginx is widely used for hosting websites, APIs, dashboards, and security tools.
